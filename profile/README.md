TripSit is a volunteer-driven harm reduction network that aims to educate individuals about the safer use of psychoactive drugs. Taking a stance of neither encouraging nor discouraging drug use, TripSit seeks to prevent drug related injuries and deaths around the world.

Our community lives on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tripsit) where we provide peer support, harm reduction information, and a safe space for people.
We also have a [website](https://tripsit.me) that hosts a wealth of information on various substances, including dosage guidelines, effects, interactions, and safety tips.
