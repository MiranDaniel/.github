# Security

Security and safety is our top priority at TripSit. We are committed to maintaining a secure environment for our community members and protecting their data. This document outlines our security practices and guidelines.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

You can contact the TripSit team privately by email at [dev@tripsit.me](mailto:dev@tripsit.me) or using the [#talk-to-mods](https://discord.com/channels/179641883222474752/970695525693288498) channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tripsit).

Please refrain from publicly disclosing any security vulnerabilities that could affect user privacy and safety until we have had sufficient time to address the issue.

## Reporting bugs and issues

Issues that do not pose a security risk can be reported publicly on the relevant GitHub repository by creating an issue or on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tripsit) in one of our development channels. Please include as much detail as possible to help us understand and resolve the issue.
